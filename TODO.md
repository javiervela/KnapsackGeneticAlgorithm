# TODO

- Handle solution feasibility
- Implement other selection, crossover, and mutation operators
- Implement other replacement strategies
- Reorder Main params to make more sense
- Default arguments for crossover and mutation probabilities?
- Secure stopping criteria:
  - Stop the algorithm if the best solution is found in the max functions evaluations stopping criterion?
  - Stop the algorithm if the best solution converges under optimal value in optimal solution criterion?
- calculate total execution of all experiments
- With 10000 evaluations stopping criterion, the algorithm generates the best solution in 1st generation.
