# TODO

- Handle solution feasibility
- Implement other selection, crossover, and mutation operators
- Implement other replacement strategies
- Reorder Main params to make more sense
- Default arguments for crossover and mutation probabilities?
- Secure stopping criteria:
  - Stop the algorithm if the best solution is found in the max functions evaluations stopping criterion?
- For very long executions, only keep some of the best solutions in the population to avoid memory issues in the metrics collector
